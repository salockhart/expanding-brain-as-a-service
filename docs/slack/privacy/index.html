        <p>Your privacy is important to us.</p>

        <p>It is Clap As A Service's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating

            below.</p>

        <ul>

                of the individual concerned.</li>
            <li>Before or at the time of collecting personal information, we will identify the purposes for which information
                is being collected.</li>
            <li>We will collect and use personal information solely for fulfilling those purposes specified by us and for other
                ancillary purposes, unless we obtain the consent of the individual concerned or as required by law.</li>
            <li>Personal data should be relevant to the purposes for which it is to be used, and, to the extent necessary for
                those purposes, should be accurate, complete, and up-to-date.</li>
            <li>We will protect personal information by using reasonable security safeguards against loss or theft, as well as
                unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.</li>
            <li>We will make readily available to customers information about our policies and practices relating to the management
                of personal information.</li>
            <li>We will only retain personal information for as long as necessary for the fulfilment of those purposes.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We are committed to conducting our business in accordance with these principles in order to ensure that the confidentiality
            of personal information is protected and maintained. Clap As A Service may change this privacy policy from time
